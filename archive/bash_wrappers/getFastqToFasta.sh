# The getZipOutput function.
# This function loops through all fastQ files extracted from the input file.
# It isolates the unqiue name of every fastQ file into strFastqFileName.
# Every fastQ file is converted into a fastA file using sed. The unique name
# is used to add the new fastA file to a new zip file. If this zip file already
# exists, the fastA file is added to it, if it does not yet exist, the function
# creates a new zip file and then adds the fastA file.
